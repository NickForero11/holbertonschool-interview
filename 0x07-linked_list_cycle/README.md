# 0x07. Linked list cycle

## Description

The objective of this project is implement a solution to check if a singly linked list has a cycle in it, which could be defined as having repeated elements grouped.

The implementation should be efficient in processing time, memory, and made in C language using the structure defined on `lists.h`

Prototype:

```C
int check_cycle(listint_t *list);

Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
```
